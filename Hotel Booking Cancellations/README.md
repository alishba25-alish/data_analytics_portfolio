# 📊 Hotel Booking Cancellation Dashboard


## 🔍 Project Overview:

This project explores hotel booking data from **2015 to 2017**, aiming to identify **booking and cancellation trends** across different dimensions.

All data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation were completed using **Microsoft Excel**.

## 🎯 Objectives:

- Analyze hotel booking cancellations over a 3-year period.
- Identify trends and patterns based on:
  - Room status (Desired / Undesired)
  - Guest types (Couples, Singles, Family)
  - Hotel types (City / Resort)
  - Monthly/seasonal bookings (Jan–Dec)

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:

- Custom columns (Guest Type & Room Status)
- Excel formulas for data transformation
- 5 Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts (Bar, Pie)
- Slicers (for year-wise filtering: 2015, 2016, 2017)
- Full-screen interactive dashboard layout

## 📈 Key Observations from Dashboard:
